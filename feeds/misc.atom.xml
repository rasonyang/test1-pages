&lt;li&gt;In this section, I would detail how I analyzed the data for this project and share some of the aggregate data visualizations of the data. In particular, I would try to visualize how the NER extracted technologies have changed over time and how they relate to the rise of the web. I would also detail some of the choices I've made in my use of methods and data visualizations to make my interpretations clear (so for example, things I did not include or experiments that I decided were not useful but provided a foundation for my thinking and later experiments/visualizations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would also detail some experiments of using TF-IDF and topic modeling to understand the conversations on the listserv and how these methods helped me to understand the data. I might not have a final answer to my initial question but showing some trends and using those to speculate about how these technologies have changed over time and how they have been discussed on the listserv. I would also detail any challenges I faced in using these methods and how I overcame them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this section, I would also include, if relevant, a brief discussion of how others have analyzed data for similar projects. So for example, I might include the following projects/examples:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scholars and/or projects who have used topic modeling or TF-IDF to understand the historic documents and how they have visualized these results to understand the development of discourses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would also again include relevant citations from our course readings and how they influenced my thinking about data analysis and methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I might include a reference to Melanie Walsh and Maria Antoniak's work with GoodReads since that influenced my approach to topic modeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I would also include any reflections on how my thinking about data analysis and methods changed through this process.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In this section, I would describe how I collected and curated the data for this project. This could include everything from how I web scraped the listserv archives to how I cleaned and transformed the data. In particular, I would try to detail how I'm meeting this requirement of the project: "some form of hand curated or computationally derived data". In the case of the humanist listserv, I would likely detail how I would used named entity recognition and manual data cleaning to extract technologies and topics from the listserv archives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I would try to have the following figures and details:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a sample of the website structure to contextualize and explain how I scraped the website, as well as detailing some of the code for scraping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a sample of the initial scraped dataset and detail choices on how to structure the data, including any choices I eventually revised.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce named entity recognition and how I used it to extract technologies from the listserv archives. Show some of the pipeline and also any validation or iterations I had to make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a sample of the final dataset and how I structured it for analysis, and detail the final documentation choices and discuss how the envisioned audiences who might use these datasets informed those choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this section, I would also include, if relevant, a brief discussion of how others have collected and curated data for similar projects. So for example, I might include the following projects/examples:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scholars who have explored Usenet archives, which are early internet discussion forums, and how they have used computational methods to understand these archives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects that have used named entity recognition to extract topics from large text corpora, and how they have structured and cleaned these datasets for analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, I would include also any citations or quotations to readings from the course that are relevant:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So for example, I might include some references to &lt;em&gt;Data Feminism&lt;/em&gt; because that influenced my approach to organizing this data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I would also include any reflections on how my thinking about data collection and curation process changed through this process.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In this section, I would detail any big picture takeaways about what I learned from this project and how it has helped me to understand working with cultural data and computing in the humanities, and then specifically what this project has found over how the development of technology over time shaped discourses on the Humanist Listserv.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would also reflect and summarize any challenges I faced in completing this project and how I overcame them, as well as any future directions I might take this project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I would also include any guidance for others who might want to utilize this data or methods in their own research, and how they might go about doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
